[Info  - 4:34:43 PM] ESLint library loaded from: /opt/html/web2/node_modules/eslint/lib/api.js
[Error - 4:34:43 PM] 
Failed to load plugin 'import' declared in 'web2/.eslintrc.js » @nuxtjs/eslint-config': Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-import'
Require stack:
- /opt/html/__placeholder__.js
Referenced from: /opt/html/web2/node_modules/@nuxtjs/eslint-config/index.js
Happened while validating /opt/html/web2/nuxt.config.js
This can happen for a couple of reasons:
1. The plugin name is spelled incorrectly in an ESLint configuration file (e.g. .eslintrc).
2. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure 'eslint-plugin-import' is installed globally as well.
3. If ESLint is installed locally, then 'eslint-plugin-import' isn't installed correctly.

Consider running eslint --debug /opt/html/web2/nuxt.config.js from a terminal to obtain a trace about the configuration files used.
